# Crisis Management Office

This project aims to enhance understanding of how large-scale systems is created and how they function between different subsystems. The primary focus of this project is on large scale system development with emphasis on System Integration between subsystems such as 911, Prime Minister Office, Emergency Forces and lastly Crisis Management Office to manage crisis.


## Getting Started Guide

### Getting Started for macOS and Unix-like

To run the server for this project, we will do the following:

1. Install `pip`
2. Install `virtualenv` and activate it
3. Install all python dependecies for this project
4. Run the server

First, we will install pip by following installation guide at 
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

```shell
$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
$ python get-pip.py
```

Next, we will install `virtualenv` using `pip`, create a virtual environment, and activate the 
environment. 

```shell
$ sudo python -m pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv cmoenv
$ source cmoenv/bin/activate
```

Next, we will install all requirements/dependencies for this project using `pip`.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, we start the server using the followin command:

```shell
# Make sure you are in <root>/src folder before running the server
$ cd src/

# Create Table in SQLite database.
$ python manage.py migrate

# Run the server.
# The website can be accessed at http://localhost:8080
$ python manage.py runserver
```

At the end of our development, we call `deactivate` in command line to deactivate `virtualenv`.

We don't install these dependecies everytime when we want to develop for this project. A normal 
workflow would be:

```shell
$ source cmoenv/bin/activate

$ cd src/
$ python manage.py runserver

# When you are done
$ deactivate
```

### Getting Started using Docker

This option would allow any platforms that are supported by Docker to build and run this project.
In addition, a MySQL backend will be used to store data, instead of SQLite.

First, we need to install Docker from https://www.docker.com/. Then, run the following commands:

```shell
# Run the server.
# The website can be accessed at http://localhost:80
$ docker-compose up

# Create Table in MySQL server
$ docker exec -it cz3003ssp3cmo_cmo_1 python manage.py migrate --settings cmo.prod_settings

# Create admin user
$ docker exec -it cz3003ssp3cmo_cmo_1 python manage.py createsuperuser --settings cmo.prod_settings
```

Both the server for this project and the MySQL server will be runned. All data in MySQL server will
be stored at `./mysql/tmp/` folder. Few useful commands to work with the MySQL server using Docker:

```shell
# Get the name of the CMO DB by running docker command, and set the name to a variable
$ docker ps
$ DOCKER_CMO_DB_NAME=cz3003ssp3cmo_db_1
$ DOCKER_CMO_NAME=cz3003ssp3cmo_cmo_1

# Execute some sql commands in the mysql server
$ docker exec -i $DOCKER_CMO_DB_NAME mysql -uroot -pcmodb  <<< "use cmodb; select database();"

# Dump all databases to command line outputs
$ docker exec cz3003ssp3cmo_db_1 sh -c 'exec mysqldump --all-databases -uroot -p"cmodb"'
```

## Linter and Formatter

We follow pep8 style guide for python.

To lint our codes:

```shell
$ pip install pylint
$ find src -iname "*.py" | xargs pylint
```

To format our codes:

```shell
$ pip install yapf
$ find src -iname "*.py" | xargs yapf -i
```
